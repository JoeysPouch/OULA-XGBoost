Work with the database schema itself has mainly focussed on machine learning applications to the Virtual Learning Environment. However, the database has a lot to offer beyond this. I want to focus just on the highest achievers and, specifically, whether having a previous degree makes a substantial difference to the probability of achieving highly. I have focussed on:\n",

I used this loop to get the sum of clicks of each type of engagement. Not all of these types of engagement are present in every module. Later on, in python, I will automatically filter this inforamtion such that only resources available for the module in question are considered as features. "
