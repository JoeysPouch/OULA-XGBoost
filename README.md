## An Experimental Machine Learning Study of High Achievers at the Open University using the Learning Analytics Data Set

This is an exploration of what contributes most to student success at the Open University, using an XGBoost algorithm and the Open University
Learning Analytics Data Set. It constitutes my first solo ML personal project (following the completion of Andrew Ng's 'Advanced Learning Algorithms' course).

### Tech Stack

- Python
- PostgreSQL

### Data
All data comes from the Open University. for more information, visit [here](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset)
